"""
This management command takes a model created with csv_to_model and provides
code to upload it to a `RawData` model in a new app.

Edit this code with the following:

1. The app name and model name (I like RawData)
2. name of the CSV in the DATA_DIR
3. Match the GeneratedModel attributes to the column headers in the source csv

Finally, save as load_raw_model.py and execute
